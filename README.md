# My Journey to Learning to Develop Decentralized Applications

## Introduction

Welcome to my journey of learning to develop decentralized applications (DApps) on the blockchain! This GitHub repository is a chronicle of my ongoing efforts to master Solidity and understand the intricacies of blockchain technology.

I'm using resources like [CryptoZombies](https://cryptozombies.io/) to guide my learning process. Step by step, I am improving my code, committing my progress here, and learning new concepts in Solidity and blockchain development.

## Motivation

After being interviewed at Ledger as a Software Security Engineer Apprentice, I decided to learn more about Solidity and its applications. During the interview, I was asked to look for security bad practices and potential vulnerabilities. This inspired me to delve deeper into the language, its best practices, and security considerations.

## Goals

1. **Learn Solidity**: Understand the syntax, structure, and functionality of the Solidity programming language.
2. **Understand Blockchain**: Gain a deep understanding of how blockchain technology works, including its benefits and limitations.
3. **Optimize Code**: Focus on optimizing the gas usage of my contracts to ensure they are cost-effective and efficient.
4. **Enhance Security**: Fine-tune the security aspects of my code by using the appropriate visibility keywords (public/private/external/internal) and implementing best practices.

## Resources

- [CryptoZombies](https://cryptozombies.io/): An interactive school that teaches you all things technical about blockchains and Solidity.

## Contributions

This repository is primarily for my personal learning and development. However, if you have suggestions or improvements, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. All contributions are welcome!
